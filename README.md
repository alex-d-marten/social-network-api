# social-network-api

## Description
This repository contains an NoSQL API that may be used with a social network application. The code contains functionality that will allow users to add thoughts, reactions to the thoughts, and add friends as well. The codebase is utilizing the npm packages "express" and "mongoose". Additionally, I am using MongoDB for the NoSQL and Insomnia to test the routes.

## Installation
This application is being run with MongoDB and Node.js and this must be installed on your computer first.

Clone the repo [here](https://github.com/alex-d-marten/social-network-api)
Run "npm init -y" and "npm install" to install the necessary packages.
